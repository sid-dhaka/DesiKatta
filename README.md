This project allows your Android smartphone to be used as a Game controller in First Person Shooter Game/Games. Your Android phone will fulfill need of both keyboard and mouse. It comes with an android app and a desktop app.
It can also be used as general purpose remote mouse to control your pc.

And this project doesn't require any setup cost. People today generally have a smartphone and wifi.

**Functionality Provided:** 
> Due to limited screen space and making a comfortabale and easily usable UI. Only limited functionality is possible.(Maybe some more keys can be added in future.)
1. Full 360 degree mouse mousement
2. Mouse1 or left click
3. Mouse2 or Right click
4. Keyboard W,A,S,D,R keys

***Make Sure you are connected on the same local network. And follow as guided by Applicatons.***

It was build with Counter Strike: Global Offensive(CS:GO) in mind. As of now it is tested with CS:GO, It works pretty well with it. It may or may not work with other First Person Shooters. Like in Valorant, everything works except mouse movement.
